MyAndroidProjects
=================

This is a collection Android Projects I have worked on. A short description of what each project is all about:-

1>survey 2.2 - This application was used to take a survey in the year 2013. 
The application stores some details and captures a photo of the person being surveyed. Then a series of Multiple Choice Questions are provided which are to be answered.
Finally all the data is stored in a flat file database.

2>iphonebackup - This is actually the server-end of a project developed using PhoneGap. It backs up all the mobile contacts to a Server and again the user can Restore back all the contacts back to the mobile.
The application was developed particularly to be run in iPhones. But as is developed in PhoneGap, with little modifications it can be made to run in Android and Windows phones as well.

I developed the following just for fun :)

3>ReadSms - When installed in an android, it automatically starts the camera on receivning an SMS. The SMS should contain a special "Triggering String" to start the camera.
It can be easily improvised to trigger different 'tasks' in the mobile by triggering with different 'Triggering Strings' in the SMS.

4>Connect - Simple application that implents a service, continuously checks whether phone is connected to internet and displays a Toast every 5 seconds.
This project shows how to implement a TimerTask in Service and also how to Display a Toast from a service using a Hander.

5>MyLocation - Displays current location by collecting data from either Network or GPS, whichever is available.
